Flowhub
=======

Flowhub translates the workflow implemented by the excellent
`git-flow <http://github.com/nvie/gitflow>` add-on to Git.

Flowhub has no meaning outside of a Git repository. After installing,
you'll have access to the ``flowhub`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

    flowhub init
    # blah blah
    flowhub feature start <name-of-feature>


See ``flowhub -h`` and its descendants for more information.
